      <p>The gamification of learning is an educational approach that seeks to motivate students by using video game design and game elements in learning environments. The goal is to maximize enjoyment and engagement by capturing the interest of learners and inspiring them to continue learning.When learners are publicly -or even privately- recognized, they feel more satisfied and accomplished. Enable learners to view awards in their learner dashboard and then share those awards with classmates, via social media, or by downloading transcripts and certificates. Gamification and rewarding are known to boost engagement and retention, plus a satisfied learner will brag about their learning experience which in the long run helps your organization thrive and scale.</p>
